**Strategy**: Create web-embeddable versions of key components for Playwright testing while maintaining extension functionality

#### **Priority 1: Core Logic Extraction** (CRITICAL)

- [ ] **Extract trigger detection and conflict resolution logic**
  - **Goal**: Isolate the logic that determines when to show hovering snippet picker
  - **Key Logic**: When typed text completes triggers AND could be start of other triggers
  - **Abstraction**: Pure functions that take (typedText, allSnippets, storesByPriority) ‚Üí shouldShowPicker + orderedSnippets
  - **Web-Testable**: No Chrome APIs, just text processing and array sorting

- [ ] **Extract simple FILO priority management**
  - **Goal**: Standalone priority calculation for snippet conflict resolution
  - **Key Logic**: Default store = priority 0 (highest), additional stores = descending priority (1, 2, 3...)
  - **Abstraction**: Functions for priority ordering, drag-drop reordering, store addition/deletion
  - **Web-Testable**: Array manipulation and sorting logic only

- [ ] **Extract snippet creation and storage logic**
  - **Goal**: Core snippet saving logic without cloud provider dependencies
  - **Key Logic**: Multi-store saving, validation, conflict handling
  - **Abstraction**: Pure functions that simulate saving to multiple stores
  - **Web-Testable**: Mock storage interfaces, validation logic

#### **Priority 2: Comprehensive Test Scenarios** (HIGH)

- [ ] **Snippet creation test battery**
  - **Simple creation**: Single store, basic trigger/expansion
  - **Multi-store creation**: Save to multiple stores with priority validation
  - **Conflict scenarios**: Same trigger in different stores, priority resolution
  - **Edge cases**: Empty triggers, special characters, long expansions
  - **Validation failures**: Read-only stores, duplicate triggers

- [ ] **Snippet usage test battery**
  - **Single match**: Clean trigger expansion
  - **Priority conflicts**: Multiple stores have same trigger, highest priority wins
  - **Ambiguous typing**: Partial trigger that could become multiple triggers
  - **Hovering picker behavior**: When to show, order of snippets, selection
  - **Edge cases**: Rapid typing, backspacing, window focus changes

- [ ] **Store management test battery**
  - **Default store behavior**: Always priority 0, cannot be deleted
  - **Store addition**: New stores get next lowest priority (FILO: newest = lowest priority)
  - **Drag-drop reordering**: All priority positions adjustable including default store
  - **Store deletion**: Non-default stores removable, priority gaps handled

#### **Priority 3: Web Test Harness** (MEDIUM)

- [ ] **Create `playwright-test-harness.html`**
  - **Interactive UI**: Text input field, snippet creation form, store management
  - **Visual feedback**: Hovering snippet picker simulation, priority indicators
  - **Test controls**: Load/reset test data, trigger specific scenarios
  - **Debug output**: Real-time display of priority calculations and conflict resolution

#### **Success Metrics**:

- Core business logic runs identically in Jest and Playwright
- 90%+ of extension functionality testable in web environment
- Playwright tests cover multi-component interaction scenarios
- Test execution time <5 seconds for full suite

---

- [ ] **üîä Priority 1: Implement Audio-Visual Feedback**
  - **Priority**: HIGH
  - **Mission**: Add a layer of premium polish with subtle, satisfying sound effects for key interactions.
  - **Actionable Steps**:
    1.  Source or create a small library of high-quality, non-intrusive sound effects (e.g., gentle plink, soft whoosh, bubble pop).
    2.  Integrate a lightweight JavaScript audio library (e.g., Howler.js) to manage sounds.
    3.  Attach sound events to specific user actions: snippet expansion in the live demo, feature card animations, bubble pops, and button clicks.
    4.  Add a master toggle (e.g., a small speaker icon in the footer) to mute all sounds for accessibility and user preference.
  - **Test Plan**:
    - **Manual Test**: Verify that each designated interaction triggers the correct sound.
    - **Manual Test**: Confirm the mute toggle correctly enables and disables all sounds across the page.
    - **Automated Test (Optional)**: Use Playwright to assert that the audio-playing functions are called on specific events.

---

- [ ] **üïπÔ∏è Priority 2: Implement "PuffPuff Playground" (Web IDE)**
  - **Priority**: LOW
  - **Mission**: Replace the simple "Try It Live" box with a lightweight, embedded code editor (e.g., Monaco) to create a fully interactive snippet management experience.
  - **Actionable Steps**:
    1.  Integrate the Monaco Editor into the `about.html` page.
    2.  Develop a UI for managing multiple virtual snippet files (e.g., `personal.json`, `work.md`).
    3.  Implement a live simulation of the priority system, visually indicating which snippet source "wins" during an expansion.
    4.  Build a non-blocking modal for filling in dynamic variables (`{variable}`).
    5.  Create an "Export to Extension" feature that uses the `chrome.runtime.sendMessage` API to send the created snippets to the user's installed extension.
  - **Test Plan**:
    - **Unit Test**: Test the snippet parsing and priority logic in isolation.
    - **Integration Test**: Verify that the Monaco editor correctly communicates with the priority simulation logic.
    - **E2E Test**: Use Playwright to script the entire user flow: create a snippet, test the expansion, use the dynamic variable modal, and click the "Export" button. Verify the message is sent correctly.

---

- [ ] **ü§ñ Priority 3: Implement Generative AI Snippet Creation**
  - **Priority**: LOW
  - **Mission**: Integrate a generative AI model into the Playground to act as an "Idea Engine" for creating snippet collections on demand.
  - **Actionable Steps**:
    1.  Set up a backend service or serverless function to handle API calls to a generative AI model (to protect API keys).
    2.  Add a prompt input field and a "Generate" button to the Playground UI.
    3.  Implement a function to take the user's prompt (e.g., "snippets for a project manager"), send it to the backend, and receive the generated JSON.
    4.  Load the returned snippet collection directly into the Playground editor.
  - **Test Plan**:
    - **Unit Test**: Test the front-end function that sends the prompt and handles the response.
    - **Integration Test**: Test the backend endpoint to ensure it correctly communicates with the AI API and returns data in the expected format.
    - **E2E Test**: Use Playwright to type a prompt, click "Generate," and assert that the editor is populated with the expected (mocked) response from the AI.

---

- [ ] **üåê Priority 4: Implement Community Snippet Library (from Google Drive)**
  - **Priority**: LOW
  - **Mission**: Build a "Discover" section that allows users to browse and import curated snippet libraries hosted in a public Google Drive folder.
  - **Actionable Steps**:
    1.  Establish a public, read-only Google Drive folder to host community snippet files (e.g., `.json` files).
    2.  Maintain a manifest file (e.g., `community-libraries.json`) within the project that contains the Google Drive File IDs and descriptions for each curated snippet library.
    3.  Implement a client-side fetch mechanism that constructs direct Google Drive download URLs (`https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=FILE_ID`) from the manifest to retrieve the snippet files without requiring a backend or API key.
    4.  Create a UI section on the page to display available libraries from the manifest.
    5.  Implement a "one-click add" feature that fetches the selected library and loads it as a new, lower-priority snippet store in the Playground.
  - **Test Plan**:
    - **Unit Test**: Test the logic for parsing the manifest and constructing the correct Google Drive download URLs.
    - **E2E Test**: Use Playwright to click on a community library, mock the `fetch` call to Google Drive, and assert that the library correctly appears as a new file in the Playground UI.

## üí° **KEY LEARNINGS FROM PHASE 6 SYSTEMATIC DEBUGGING**

### **What Works (Proven Success Pattern)**:

- **Individual test file focus**: Complete one test file 100% before moving to next
- **Root cause analysis**: Identify exact cause (method conflicts, regex patterns, missing mocks)
- **Targeted fixes**: Make minimal changes that directly address root cause
- **Immediate validation**: Run test file after each fix to confirm 100% success
- **Pattern recognition**: Apply successful debugging patterns to similar issues

### **Common Pitfalls Avoided**:

- **Method naming conflicts**: Watch for TypeScript resolution ambiguity with overloaded methods
- **Environment detection**: Test environment vs production environment behavior differences
- **Regex pattern errors**: Incorrect escaping or pattern matching in content processing
- **Mock configuration**: Missing Chrome API or global object mocks in test setup
- **Scope creep**: Don't fix multiple unrelated issues simultaneously
