## üìã Collaborative Text Expander - Implementation Roadmap

### üéØ Project Overview
This document outlines the implementation plan for a powerful, collaborative text expansion Chrome extension. The project's foundation is the **`CloudAdapter` architecture**, a unified interface for syncing snippets from multiple cloud providers (Google Drive, Dropbox, etc.). It supports **multi-scope synchronization** ("Org Mode") for personal, department, and organization-level snippet libraries, with a focus on offline-first performance, security, and extensibility.

## CLAUDE-TODONE
**Any task in CLAUDE-TODO.md that is finished should be moved into CLAUDE-TODONE.md (create the file if need be) to prevent todo bloat!**

## ‚úÖ CRITICAL ISSUES RESOLVED IN v0.6.x

**Status**: All critical blocking issues have been resolved as of version 0.6.3:

1. **‚úÖ FIXED**: Password field exclusion - Enhanced with comprehensive security checks (v0.6.0)
2. **‚úÖ FIXED**: Build compilation errors in options.ts resolved (v0.6.0)  
3. **üü° PARTIAL**: Google Picker API still needs implementation (non-blocking)
4. **‚úÖ FIXED**: Service worker messaging and notification issues resolved (v0.6.0)
5. **üü° ONGOING**: E2E testing framework needs Playwright configuration
6. **‚úÖ IMPROVED**: HTML sanitization enhanced with XSS protection utilities (v0.6.1)

## üöÄ NEW FEATURE COMPLETED

**‚úÖ TRIGGER OVERLAP CYCLING**: Revolutionary disambiguation system (v0.6.0)
- Tab-based cycling through overlapping triggers (e.g., `;a` ‚Üí `;addr` ‚Üí `;about`)
- Visual overlay with content previews above cursor
- Intelligent disambiguation with seamless expansion workflow
- Escape key cancellation and non-Tab key cementing

## ü§ñ High-Priority CI/CD Enhancements

**Priority**: High - Implement immediately to improve development velocity and enforce project conventions.

### 1. Automated Code Quality & Consistency
- [ ] **Linting and Formatting Checks**: Add a step in `ci.yml` to run a linter (e.g., `eslint`) and a formatter check (`prettier --check .`). This ensures all committed code adheres to the project's style guide.
- [ ] **Pre-commit Hooks**: Use a tool like `husky` to run these checks *locally* before a commit can be made. This provides an immediate feedback loop.

### 2. Automated Building & Versioning
- [ ] **Build Verification**: Add a step to the CI pipeline that runs `npm run build`. This guarantees that the extension is always buildable.
- [ ] **Automated Version Bump Check**: Create a GitHub Action that fails if a pull request doesn't include a version bump in `manifest.json` and `package.json`, enforcing the versioning workflow.

---

## üò¥ Low-Priority CI/CD Enhancements (Super Low Priority)

**Priority**: Stretch goal (implement when bored, after everything else is 100% complete).

### 3. Automated Releases & Deployment
- [ ] **Create a Draft Release Action**: Set up a manually triggered GitHub action that runs tests, builds the project, packages the `build/` directory into a versioned `.zip` file, and creates a draft release on GitHub with the zip as an asset.
- [ ] **(Advanced) Automated Publishing**: Extend the release action to automatically upload the release `.zip` to the Chrome Web Store.

### 4. Enhanced Project Management & LLM Feedback Loop
- [ ] **Commit Message Enforcement**: Add a CI step to validate that commit messages on a pull request adhere to the `TypeEmojiMeaning` format defined in `CLAUDE.md`.
- [ ] **Automated `CLAUDE-TODO.md` Management**: Create a script to check for inconsistencies between completed tasks in the TODO file and the git history.
- [ ] **Automated Test Coverage Reports**: Configure CI to upload test coverage reports as artifacts and/or post the coverage percentage as a comment on pull requests.

## üöÄ Stretch Goals & Future Enhancements (When Bored / Pie in the Sky)

### üîê ENCRYPTED SNIPPETS SUPPORT - **SUPER LOW PRIORITY**
**Priority**: Stretch goal (implement when bored, after everything else is 100% complete)

**Rationale**: Add privacy and security for sensitive snippets (passwords, API keys, personal info):
- Encrypt snippet content before storing in cloud
- Support multiple encryption methods for flexibility
- Maintain backwards compatibility with unencrypted snippets

**Encryption Methods to Support**:
- **Local Key Pairs** (SSH-style): Generate public/private key pairs locally
- **Password-based**: User-provided password with PBKDF2/Argon2 key derivation
- **Passkey/WebAuthn**: Modern biometric/hardware key authentication
- **Hybrid**: Combine methods for different security levels

**Implementation Approach**:
- **Payload Encryption**: Encrypt only snippet content, leave metadata visible
- **Full Encryption**: Encrypt entire snippet objects (including triggers, metadata)
- **Selective Encryption**: User chooses per-snippet or per-folder encryption level
- **Key Management**: Secure local storage of encryption keys with browser APIs

**Technical Components**:
- Web Crypto API for encryption operations
- Key derivation functions (PBKDF2, Argon2)
- WebAuthn integration for passkey support
- Encrypted storage format with version compatibility
- Key rotation and recovery mechanisms

**UI Enhancements**:
- Encryption settings in options page
- Per-snippet encryption toggle
- Key management interface
- Recovery/backup key generation
- Visual indicators for encrypted vs unencrypted content

**Security Considerations**:
- Zero-knowledge architecture (keys never leave device)
- Secure key storage using browser keychain APIs
- Protection against key extraction attacks
- Optional key escrow for enterprise users

## üìù Editorial Decision: Keep Snippet Editing

### ‚úÖ SNIPPET EDITING FUNCTIONALITY - **KEEP AS-IS**
**Rationale**: The editing functionality works and provides value:
- Useful for quick edits and snippet management
- No significant maintenance burden
- Gives users choice between in-app editing and external tools
- Complements the download-and-expand core functionality

**Keep Current Features**:
- Snippet editing UI in popup/options pages
- Inline editing functionality  
- "Create new snippet" interfaces
- Snippet management forms
- Import/export capabilities

### üìù FUTURE: Multi-Format Editing Support - **LOW PRIORITY**
**Priority**: Low (after core features and encryption are complete)

**Rationale**: Support rich snippet formats for advanced use cases:
- Enable structured snippet content with metadata
- Support different content types and rendering
- Maintain backwards compatibility with simple text snippets

**Four Primary Formats to Support**:

1. **Plain Text** (current default)
   - Simple text expansion
   - No formatting or metadata
   - Backwards compatible with existing snippets

2. **JSON Format**
   ```json
   {
     "content": "Hello {name}!",
     "variables": ["name"],
     "description": "Greeting with personalization"
   }
   ```

3. **Markdown Format** (with YAML frontmatter)
   ```yaml
   ---
   description: "Code snippet with syntax highlighting"
   language: "javascript"
   variables: ["functionName"]
   ---
   ```javascript
   function {functionName}() {
     console.log("Hello world!");
   }
   ```
   
4. **HTML Format** (with YAML frontmatter)
   ```yaml
   ---
   description: "Rich formatted content"
   contentType: "html"
   variables: ["title", "content"]
   ---
   <div class="card">
     <h3>{title}</h3>
     <p>{content}</p>
   </div>
   ```

**Implementation Features**:
- **Format Detection**: Auto-detect format based on content structure
- **Format Conversion**: Convert between formats when possible
- **Syntax Highlighting**: Code editor with format-specific highlighting
- **YAML Frontmatter Parser**: Extract metadata from YAML headers
- **Variable Extraction**: Automatically detect placeholders in content
- **Preview Mode**: Live preview of formatted content
- **Validation**: Format-specific validation and error reporting

**UI Enhancements**:
- Format selector dropdown in snippet editor
- Split-pane editor (raw content / preview)
- Syntax highlighting with Monaco Editor or CodeMirror
- YAML frontmatter folding/collapsing
- Template wizards for common formats
- Import/export with format preservation

**Technical Considerations**:
- Backwards compatibility with existing plain text snippets
- Efficient parsing and rendering of different formats
- Secure HTML sanitization for HTML format
- Markdown rendering with security considerations
- JSON schema validation for structured content

*Last updated: 2025-07-04*
*Project: PuffPuffPaste - Collaborative Text Expander*  
*Current Version: 0.11.0*

## üö® VERSION MANAGEMENT REMINDER
**CRITICAL**: Bump version with EVERY fix and feature:
- `npm run version:fix` for bug fixes (0.x.PATCH)
- `npm run version:feature` for new features (0.MINOR.x)  
- NEVER bump the first 0 - reserved for live/semver release
- Every commit needs a version bump so user can verify updates

*TDD Approach: Write failing tests first, implement just enough to pass, refactor.*
