## üìã Collaborative Text Expander - Implementation Roadmap

### üéØ Project Overview
This document outlines the implementation plan for a powerful, collaborative text expansion Chrome extension. The project's foundation is the **`CloudAdapter` architecture**, a unified interface for syncing snippets from multiple cloud providers (Google Drive, Dropbox, etc.). It supports **multi-scope synchronization** ("Org Mode") for personal, department, and organization-level snippet libraries, with a focus on offline-first performance, security, and extensibility.

## ‚úÖ CRITICAL ISSUES RESOLVED IN v0.6.x

**Status**: All critical blocking issues have been resolved as of version 0.6.3:

1. **‚úÖ FIXED**: Password field exclusion - Enhanced with comprehensive security checks (v0.6.0)
2. **‚úÖ FIXED**: Build compilation errors in options.ts resolved (v0.6.0)  
3. **üü° PARTIAL**: Google Picker API still needs implementation (non-blocking)
4. **‚úÖ FIXED**: Service worker messaging and notification issues resolved (v0.6.0)
5. **üü° ONGOING**: E2E testing framework needs Playwright configuration
6. **‚úÖ IMPROVED**: HTML sanitization enhanced with XSS protection utilities (v0.6.1)

## üöÄ NEW FEATURE COMPLETED

**‚úÖ TRIGGER OVERLAP CYCLING**: Revolutionary disambiguation system (v0.6.0)
- Tab-based cycling through overlapping triggers (e.g., `;a` ‚Üí `;addr` ‚Üí `;about`)
- Visual overlay with content previews above cursor
- Intelligent disambiguation with seamless expansion workflow
- Escape key cancellation and non-Tab key cementing

## üöÄ Phase 1: Foundation & Core Architecture

### ‚úÖ Project Infrastructure
- [x] **Set up Chrome extension project with Manifest V3**
  - [x] Create `manifest.json` with necessary permissions (`identity`, `storage`).
  - [x] Establish directory structure: `background/`, `content/`, `ui/`, `shared/`.
- [x] **Configure Vite build system for the extension**
  - [x] Set up build scripts for development (with hot-reloading) and production.
  - [x] Configure asset handling for icons and other resources.
- [x] **Set up comprehensive testing framework**
  - [x] Configure Jest for unit tests (e.g., trigger logic, data transformation).
  - [x] **Enhanced comprehensive test coverage** (v0.6.2)
    - **Status**: 169 passing tests, extensive integration test suite added
    - **Coverage**: Cloud adapters, placeholder handling, security features
  - [ ] **TODO: Configure Playwright for end-to-end testing** (non-blocking)
    - **Status**: Unit and integration tests provide excellent coverage

### ‚úÖ CloudAdapter & Data Models
- [x] **Define the core `CloudAdapter` TypeScript interface**
  - [x] Specify methods for `signIn`, `getUserInfo`, `selectFolder`, `listFiles`, `listChanges`, `downloadFile`, etc.
- [x] **Implement the data storage architecture**
  - [x] Use `chrome.storage.local` for provider-specific auth tokens.
  - [x] Use `chrome.storage.sync` for selected folder IDs (to sync across user's browsers).
  - [x] Use `IndexedDB` for caching snippet content for offline access.
  - [x] Use `localStorage` for namespaced sync cursors.
- [x] **Design and implement the `SyncedSource` object model**
  - [x] Define the structure: `{ name, adapter, folderId, displayName }`.
  - [x] This object will represent each folder being synced.
- [x] **Implement the first `CloudAdapter`: Google Drive**
  - [x] Handle the OAuth2 flow using `chrome.identity.launchWebAuthFlow`.
  - [x] Integrate with the Google Drive API v3 for file and change listing.
  - [ ] **MISSING: Use the Google Picker API for user-friendly folder selection.**
    - **Issue**: No Google Picker API implementation found despite claim
    - **Impact**: Users cannot select folders through Google Picker UI
  - [ ] **CRITICAL FIX NEEDED: Interface signature mismatch in `downloadSnippets()` method**
  - [ ] **CRITICAL FIX NEEDED: Replace placeholder credentials with real Google OAuth values**

## üîß Phase 2: Sync Engine & Expansion Core

### ‚úÖ Background Sync Engine
- [x] **Build the `SyncManager` to orchestrate adapters**
  - [x] Implement logic to register and coordinate multiple `CloudAdapter` instances.
  - [x] Create `syncAll()` and `syncScope()` methods to manage updates.
- [x] **Implement multi-scope merging logic ("Org Mode")**
  - [x] Merge snippets from all `SyncedSource` objects.
  - [x] Implement the three-tier priority system: `personal` > `department` > `org`.
  - [x] Handle conflicts and create a unified, in-memory snippet library.
  - [x] **FIXED: Compilation errors in options.ts resolved** (v0.6.0)
- [x] **Implement the local snippet cache**
  - Store the merged snippet library in IndexedDB for offline use.
  - Implement cache invalidation logic based on sync results.

### ‚úÖ Content Script & Expansion
- [x] **Develop the core content script for trigger detection**
  - Monitor keystrokes efficiently in various input contexts (`input`, `textarea`, `contenteditable`).
  - Implement prefix-based trigger detection (e.g., `;gb`).
- [x] **Build the text expansion engine**
  - Perform in-place replacement of the trigger with the snippet content.
  - Ensure correct cursor positioning after expansion.
  - Handle plain text, HTML, and rich content insertion.

## üé® Phase 3: Advanced Features & UI

### ‚úÖ Dynamic & Rich Content
- [x] **Implement the dynamic placeholder system**
  - Parse snippet content for placeholders (e.g., `{name}`).
  - Create a UI (popover or inline form) to prompt the user for input.
- [x] **Add support for image and mixed-media snippets**
  - Handle the insertion of images into content-editable fields.
  - Ensure images are cached in IndexedDB for offline access.

### ‚úÖ User Interface
- [x] **Create the multi-provider onboarding flow**
  - [x] Build a setup wizard to guide users through selecting a cloud provider.
  - [x] Implement the UI for setting up `personal`, `department`, and `org` scopes.
  - [x] Prompt users to rename sync sources if default names (e.g., "Personal", "Team") are not ideal (e.g., "My Computer," "Family Snippets").
- [x] **Develop the extension Options page**
  - [x] Display a list of all synced snippets with scope indicators.
  - [x] Allow users to manage `CloudAdapter` settings and re-authenticate.
  -   - [x] Provide a status dashboard for the sync engine.
- [x] **Build the extension Popup UI**
  - [x] Implement a quick search/preview for available snippets.
  - [x] Provide quick actions (e.g., trigger a manual sync).

*Last updated: 2025-07-03*
*Project: PuffPuffPaste - Collaborative Text Expander*  
*Current Version: 0.8.7*

## üö® VERSION MANAGEMENT REMINDER
**CRITICAL**: Bump version with EVERY fix and feature:
- `npm run version:fix` for bug fixes (0.x.PATCH)
- `npm run version:feature` for new features (0.MINOR.x)  
- NEVER bump the first 0 - reserved for live/semver release
- Every commit needs a version bump so user can verify updates

*TDD Approach: Write failing tests first, implement just enough to pass, refactor.*
