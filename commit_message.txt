Removes the TinyMCE integration and all related files.

## What Changed
- Deleted all source files related to the TinyMCE editor wrapper.
- Removed the `tinymce` dependency from `package.json`.

## Why This Change
- The TinyMCE rich text editor was a planned feature that is no longer needed.
- Removing it reduces the codebase size, complexity, and dependency footprint.

## How It Works
- All files with `tinymce` in their names were deleted.
- The `package.json` was updated to remove the dependency.

## Testing
- Not applicable, as this commit only removes unused code.
