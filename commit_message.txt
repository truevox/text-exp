Adds extensive debug logging to diagnose folder selection errors.

## What Changed
- Added detailed logging to `syncManager.getCloudFolders()`.
- Enhanced the `FolderPickerComponent` with more comprehensive error logging.

## Why This Change
- To help identify the root cause of a critical user-blocking bug in the folder selection process.
- The new logging will provide a clear execution trace and highlight where the authentication or data-fetching flow is failing.

## How It Works
- The changes introduce `console.log` statements at key points in the folder selection and sync manager logic.
- These logs will output debug information to the browser's developer console.

## Testing
- This change is a debugging measure and does not have specific tests. It will be validated by manually testing the folder selection process and observing the console output.
