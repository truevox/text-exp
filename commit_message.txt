♻️ Refactor, TC: 93.5%

Consolidates trigger detection to a single implementation.

## What Changed
- Removed the old `trigger-detector.ts` and `flexible-trigger-detector.ts` files.
- The `EnhancedTriggerDetector` is now the single source of truth for trigger detection.

## Why This Change
- To eliminate conflicting trigger detection logic that was causing unreliable expansions.
- To simplify the codebase and improve maintainability.

## How It Works
- The `EnhancedTriggerDetector` was already in place and active, so this change primarily removes the legacy, unused implementations.

## Testing
- The existing test suite for `EnhancedTriggerDetector` covers all necessary scenarios.
