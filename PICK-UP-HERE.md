# 🚀 PuffPuffPaste - Current Status & Next Steps

## 📍 Current State (v0.8.3)
**MAJOR BREAKTHROUGH:** Google Drive authentication is fully working! User has configured real OAuth client ID and enabled Google Drive API.

## 🔧 Recent Work Completed
**Started from:** Critical Google Drive file search failing with placeholder folder ID instead of real Google Drive folder ID

**Completed in v0.8.0-0.8.3:**
1. **Google Drive OAuth Fixed**: 
   - ✅ User provided real Google OAuth client ID: `1037463573947-mjb7i96il5j0b2ul3ou7c1vld0b0q96a.apps.googleusercontent.com`
   - ✅ User added Chrome Extension ID `lpidapafpffopknnkifglcdfppfcpdnf` to OAuth client configuration
   - ✅ User enabled Google Drive API in Google Cloud Console project 1037463573947
   - ✅ Fixed `isAuthenticated()` method name mismatch in sync manager
   - ✅ Chrome identity API authentication now works perfectly

2. **Google Drive API Integration**:
   - ✅ OAuth authentication fully functional using Chrome's `identity.getAuthToken()`
   - ✅ Folder listing and selection working
   - ✅ Manual OAuth fallback implemented for edge cases
   - ✅ Added comprehensive debug logging for folder selection and file search

3. **UI Improvements**:
   - ✅ Removed duplicate "Add Snippet" button from popup empty state
   - ✅ Updated constants.ts with correct Google OAuth v2 endpoint

## 🚨 CRITICAL ISSUE IDENTIFIED
**Root Cause Found:** The sync manager is using hardcoded placeholder `'personal-folder-id'` instead of the actual Google Drive folder ID returned from folder selection.

**Problem Location:** `/src/background/sync-manager.ts` line 184 in `syncNow()` method:
```typescript
// WRONG - hardcoded placeholder
folderId: 'personal-folder-id', // Placeholder

// NEEDS TO BE - actual folder ID from storage
folderId: personalSource.folderId, // Real Google Drive folder ID
```

## 🎯 IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS (30 seconds of work)

### 🚨 PRIMARY ISSUE TO FIX
**Fix folder ID flow in sync manager:**
1. ✅ **PARTIALLY FIXED**: Modified `syncNow()` to load scoped sources from `ExtensionStorage.getScopedSources()`
2. ❌ **NEEDS COMPLETION**: The `selectFolder()` method needs to save the selected folder to storage via `ExtensionStorage.setScopedSources()`

**Missing Link:** When user selects a Google Drive folder, it returns the correct folder ID but doesn't persist it for sync operations.

### 🔧 EXACT FIX NEEDED
1. **Update `selectFolder()` method** in sync manager to save selected folder to storage:
```typescript
// After successful folder selection:
await ExtensionStorage.setScopedSources([{
  name: 'personal',
  adapter: this.currentAdapter,
  folderId: folderHandle.folderId,
  displayName: folderHandle.folderName,
}]);
```

2. **Test the complete flow:**
   - Select Google Drive folder in options page
   - Verify folder ID is saved to storage
   - Run sync operation
   - Confirm file search uses real folder ID instead of 'personal-folder-id'

## 🧪 CONSOLE LOG EVIDENCE
User's latest logs show the issue clearly:
```
🔍 Search URL: ...and%20'personal-folder-id'%20in%20parents
🔍 Search response status: 404
"message": "File not found: ."
```

The debug logging added shows folder selection returns real Google Drive folder IDs, but sync operations still use the placeholder.

## 💾 Architecture Status
- ✅ **Google Drive OAuth**: WORKING PERFECTLY
- ✅ **Folder selection**: Returns correct folder IDs  
- ❌ **Folder persistence**: Not saving selected folders to storage
- ❌ **Sync operations**: Using placeholder instead of real folder IDs

## 📁 Key Files to Modify Next
- `src/background/sync-manager.ts` - Save selected folder to storage in `selectFolder()` method
- Test complete folder selection → sync flow

## 🎉 MAJOR WIN
Authentication infrastructure is solid. Only missing the folder ID persistence piece!
