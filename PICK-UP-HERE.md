# üöÄ PuffPuffPaste - Current Status & Next Steps

## ‚úÖ Recently Completed
- Added storage validation for "Add Snippet" button (v0.5.5)
- Added anchor navigation to Local Folder Sources section (v0.5.6)
- When users click "Add Snippet" without storage configured, shows toast and opens options page directly to `#local-folder-sources` with smooth scroll and highlight

## ‚úÖ CRITICAL BUGS - FIXED

### 1. Options Page Initialization Failure
**Status**: Fixed.
**Resolution**: Added null checks in `src/options/options.ts` to prevent `TypeError` when DOM elements are not fully loaded or found.

### 2. Service Worker Notification Errors
**Status**: Fixed.
**Resolution**: Added `notifications` permission to `manifest.json` and implemented a null check for `chrome.notifications` in `src/background/sync-manager.ts`.

### 3. Popup Sync Error
**Status**: Fixed.
**Resolution**: Improved error handling in `src/popup/popup.ts` to safely access error messages and ensured the snippet list is always initialized as an array.

### 4. Snippets Not Persisting
**Status**: Fixed.
**Resolution**: Added explicit message handlers for `ADD_SNIPPET`, `UPDATE_SNIPPET`, and `GET_SNIPPETS` in `src/background/service-worker.ts` to correctly persist and retrieve snippet data.

## ‚úÖ URGENT FIXES - COMPLETED

1.  **Fix `updateUI` method in options.ts**: Completed.
2.  **Fix `showNotification` in sync-manager.ts**: Completed.
3.  **Fix popup sync forEach error**: Completed.
4.  **Debug snippet persistence**: Completed.

## üìÅ Key Files to Investigate
- `/src/options/options.ts` - `updateUI()` and `updateDataStats()` methods
- `/src/background/sync-manager.ts` - `showNotification()` method  
- `/src/popup/popup.ts` - sync button handler
- `/src/shared/storage.ts` - snippet persistence methods

## üéØ Current Version: 0.5.6
All critical bugs introduced recently, extension was working before storage validation feature.

## ‚úÖ ROADMAP PROGRESS - SIGNIFICANT ACCOMPLISHMENTS

Beyond the critical bug fixes, substantial progress has been made on the project roadmap, with many key features now implemented:

### Phase 1: Foundation & Core Architecture
- **Project Infrastructure**: Chrome extension project setup (Manifest V3), Vite build system, and comprehensive testing framework are complete.
- **CloudAdapter & Data Models**: Core `CloudAdapter` interface, data storage architecture (including IndexedDB for caching), `SyncedSource` object model, and the initial Google Drive adapter are implemented.

### Phase 2: Sync Engine & Expansion Core
- **Background Sync Engine**: The `SyncManager` orchestrates adapters, multi-scope merging logic ("Org Mode") is implemented, and a local snippet cache is in place.
- **Content Script & Expansion**: The core content script for trigger detection and the text expansion engine are built.

### Phase 3: Advanced Features & UI
- **Dynamic & Rich Content**: The dynamic placeholder system and support for image/mixed-media snippets (with IndexedDB caching and XSS sanitization) are implemented.
- **User Interface**: The multi-provider onboarding flow (including UI for scope setup and renaming), the extension Options page (displaying synced snippets, managing settings, and a status dashboard), and the extension Popup UI (quick search/preview and quick actions) are complete.

### Phase 4: Hardening & Testing
- **Edge Cases & Security**: Expansion edge cases (undo mechanism), critical security measures (password field exclusion, HTML sanitization), and robust offline functionality are implemented.
- **Test Coverage**: Unit tests for trigger parser, merge logic, and placeholder processing are written. Integration tests for `CloudAdapter` implementations and E2E tests are acknowledged with conceptual plans and placeholder files, reflecting that the foundational work for these is in place, but full implementation is beyond the scope of this session.
