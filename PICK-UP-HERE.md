## Current Status: Google Drive Sync Working but Text Expansion Failing

**Version:** 0.10.2 (just updated with comprehensive sync debugging)
**Extension ID:** hlhpgfjffmigppdbhopljldjplpffhmb

## Problem Summary

The Google Drive sync is now **WORKING CORRECTLY** - the logs show:
-  Successfully authenticated with Google Drive
-  Found the `text-expander-snippets.json` file (fileId: 1HUiDK1jTOWpPSVWRmaVHH6W_FbJZzHsN)
-  Downloaded 1 snippet from Google Drive (`{trigger: ";eata", content: "Bag of Dicks!!"}`)
-  Merged 1 snippet successfully
-  Updated local storage

**BUT** text expansion is still failing:
- User types `;eata` followed by Tab/Space 
- Content script shows "no_match" state
- The snippet is NOT being found during trigger detection

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue is a **DISCONNECT between sync and content script**:

1. **Sync Process**  Downloads snippets to extension storage correctly
2. **Content Script** L Not reading the updated snippets from storage

### Evidence from Logs:
- Content script logs: `=Ú Loaded snippets: 5 total` (should be 6 with the synced snippet)
- Sync logs: `= Sync completed, merged 1 snippets` 
- **The content script is not picking up the newly synced snippet**

## Technical Details

### Files Modified for Debugging (v0.10.2):
- `src/background/multi-scope-sync-manager.ts` - Added detailed sync logging
- `src/background/cloud-adapters/google-drive-adapter.ts` - Added download logging
- `src/background/sync-manager.ts` - Added merge logging

### Current Sync Flow (Working):
1. User clicks sync in popup
2. `syncNow()` called in sync-manager.ts
3. Downloads from Google Drive folder (folderId: undefined = root)
4. Finds and parses `text-expander-snippets.json`
5. Merges with local snippets
6. Updates extension storage via `ExtensionStorage.setSnippets()`

### Content Script Issue (Broken):
- Content script loads snippets on initialization
- **Missing**: Content script doesn't refresh snippets after sync completes
- **Need**: Message/event system to notify content script of snippet updates

## Next Steps to Fix

### 1. **Content Script Refresh** (PRIORITY 1)
The content script needs to refresh its snippet cache when sync completes:

```typescript
// In background/service-worker.ts - after successful sync
chrome.tabs.query({}, (tabs) => {
  tabs.forEach(tab => {
    chrome.tabs.sendMessage(tab.id, { type: 'SNIPPETS_UPDATED' });
  });
});

// In content script - add message listener
chrome.runtime.onMessage.addListener((message) => {
  if (message.type === 'SNIPPETS_UPDATED') {
    this.loadSnippets(); // Refresh from storage
  }
});
```

### 2. **Verify Storage Update**
Add logging to confirm `ExtensionStorage.setSnippets()` is actually updating the storage:

```typescript
// In storage.js
console.log('=¾ Updating storage with snippets:', snippets.length);
```

### 3. **Test Content Script Load**
Verify content script `loadSnippets()` method is reading from the correct storage location.

## User's Selected Folder

- **Folder:** "Personal" inside "PuffPuffPaste Snippets" 
- **Folder ID:** 1ai6NEcpDaun9oWNpGEIAhO3_Qt1P-qyf
- **Issue:** Sync is searching in root instead of selected folder
- **Fix Needed:** Update sync to use the user's selected folder ID

## Files to Check/Modify

1. **content/content-script.js** - Add message listener for snippet updates
2. **background/service-worker.ts** - Broadcast snippet update messages
3. **shared/storage.js** - Add logging to storage operations
4. **sync-manager.ts** - Use correct folder ID from user selection

## Debugging Commands

```bash
# Version management
npm run version:fix  # Bump to 0.10.3

# Check storage contents in DevTools
chrome.storage.local.get(['snippets'], console.log)

# Monitor content script logs
# Look for "=Ú Loaded snippets: X total" after sync
```

## Expected Behavior After Fix

1. User syncs in popup ’ "Sync completed successfully"
2. Content script logs: `=Ú Loaded snippets: 6 total` (or appropriate count)
3. User types `;eata` ’ Gets "Bag of Dicks!!" expansion

## Context for Next Developer

The sync architecture is sound and working. The final piece is ensuring the content script refreshes its snippet cache when new snippets are synced from cloud storage. This is a common pattern in Chrome extensions - background scripts update storage, then notify content scripts to refresh their cached data.
