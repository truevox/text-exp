# ðŸš€ PuffPuffPaste - Current Status & Next Steps

## âœ… RESOLVED: Content Script ES Module Problem

The extension has been successfully rebranded to "PuffPuffPaste" with the slogan "Blow up your words!" and all icons are properly configured. **The content script bundling issue and version sync problems have been completely resolved!**

### Solution Implemented

1. **Created Dedicated Vite Config** - Built `vite.content.config.ts` for content script-specific IIFE bundling
2. **Replaced Manual Bundling** - Replaced fragile manual script concatenation with proper Vite library mode
3. **Added Version Sync System** - Created `scripts/sync-version.js` to auto-sync version from package.json to runtime
4. **Updated Build Pipeline** - Modified build scripts to use proper dependency management

### Current Files Status

- âœ… Extension builds successfully with `npm run build`
- âœ… Content script properly built as IIFE (45.16 kB) without variable conflicts  
- âœ… Version automatically synced (v0.5.2) between package.json and runtime
- âœ… Background service worker works and shows correct version
- âœ… Built-in test snippet (`;htest` â†’ "Hello World!") is configured
- ðŸ”„ **Ready for Testing**: Extension should now function without runtime errors

### Key Technical Fixes

- **`vite.content.config.ts`** - Dedicated content script build configuration
- **`scripts/sync-version.js`** - Automatic version synchronization
- **`build-content-script.js`** - Simplified Vite-based content script builder
- **`src/utils/version.ts`** - Auto-generated with correct logVersion export

### Test Plan

1. âœ… Build extension: `npm run build` (Working)
2. Load in Chrome developer mode from `build/` directory
3. Navigate to any text field  
4. Type `;htest` followed by space/tab
5. Should expand to "Hello World!" without console errors
6. First use should show customization modal

### Technical Architecture

- **Content Script**: Properly bundled IIFE with all dependencies inlined
- **Background Service Worker**: ESM module with correct version logging
- **Version Management**: Automatic sync between package.json and runtime
- **Build Process**: Robust Vite-based bundling replacing manual concatenation

The extension architecture is now solid and should function properly in Chrome without the previous `ReferenceError: n is not defined` errors.
