Excellent! 🎉 The text replacement system
  is now complete and committed. Let me
  continue with the next high-priority task:
  implementing the basic content script for 
  trigger detection and text expansion.

● Update Todos
  ⎿ ☒ Build trigger detection system with    
      prefix handling (default ';')
    ☒ Design and implement JSON schema for 
      snippet data model
    ☒ Configure Vite build system for Chrome 
      extension
    ☒ Set up Chrome extension project 
      structure with Manifest V3
    ☒ Set up version management system with 
      initial 0.1.0 version
    ☒ Update README.md to document unified 
      CloudAdapter interface with 
      multi-scope sync (personal, 
      department, org)
    ☒ Implement text replacement logic for 
      various input types
    ☒ Set up testing framework (unit, 
      integration, e2e with Playwright)
    ☐ Implement basic content script for 
      trigger detection and text expansion
    ☐ Implement Google Drive OAuth2
      authentication using chrome.identity
      API
    ☐ Create background service worker for
      Drive sync and snippet management
    ☐ Implement local snippet cache using
      chrome.storage.local
    ☐ Create dynamic placeholder system with
      user input prompts
    ☐ Add support for image snippets and
      mixed text/image content
    ☐ Implement two-way sync with Google
      Drive for snippet files
    ☐ Build merging logic for personal vs
      shared snippet libraries
    ☐ Create extension options page for
      snippet management and settings
    ☐ Create initial setup flow with Google
      Drive folder selection
    ☐ Handle edge cases (overlapping
      triggers, accidental expansion, etc.)
    ☐ Implement security measures (password
      field exclusion, content sanitization)
    ☐ Ensure robust offline functionality
      with cached data
    ☐ Build popup UI for quick snippet
      search and management

● Now let me examine the existing content
  script and implement the integration
  between trigger detection and text
  replacement using TDD:

● Read(src/content/content-script.ts)
  ⎿  Read 289 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● The content script looks comprehensive but
  has some issues - it's using the old
  TriggerDetector API instead of the new
  trie-based one we just implemented. I need
  to update it to use the new API and write
  comprehensive tests. Let me start by
  writing tests first, then updating the
  implementation:

● Write(tests/unit/content-script.test.ts)
  ⎿  Wrote 680 lines to                      
     tests/unit/content-script.test.ts
     /**
      * Unit tests for content script
      * Following TDD approach - tests written
      first to define expected behavior
      */
     import { TriggerDetector, TriggerState }
     from
     '../../src/content/trigger-detector';
     import { TextReplacer } from
     '../../src/content/text-replacer';
     import { PlaceholderHandler } from
     '../../src/content/placeholder-handler';
     import { ExtensionStorage } from
     '../../src/shared/storage';
     import { TextSnippet } from
     '../../src/shared/types';
