# üöÄ PuffPuffPaste - Current Status & Next Steps

## üìç Current State (v0.7.0)
**CRITICAL DECISION:** User decided to abandon local filesystem support entirely. Focus on cloud storage + browser internal storage only.

## üîß Recent Work Completed
**Started from:** Options page errors "t.getSyncStatus is not a function" + continuous local filesystem sync failures

**Fixed in v0.6.5-0.6.6:**
1. **getSyncStatus error**: Added missing `CloudProvider`/`SnippetScope` imports to messaging.ts, added `GET_SYNC_STATUS` to MessageType enum, added optional `selectFolder()` to CloudAdapter interface
2. **Directory handle permissions**: File System Access API handles can't persist across service worker restarts (browser security). Fixed by:
   - Disabled auto-sync for `local-filesystem` provider in sync manager
   - Modified `syncAllSources()` to skip local filesystem sources
   - Added missing `ScopedSource` type definition
3. **UI cleanup**: Removed team sync code section from options page (no more team code input field)

**Completed in v0.7.0:**
4. **Local filesystem removal**: Completely removed local filesystem support:
   - ‚úÖ Deleted `local-filesystem-adapter.ts`
   - ‚úÖ Removed `'local-filesystem'` from CloudProvider type
   - ‚úÖ Removed all local filesystem UI elements from options page
   - ‚úÖ Removed local filesystem methods and event handlers
   - ‚úÖ Cleaned up service worker message handlers
5. **Google Drive implementation**: Enhanced Google Drive adapter:
   - ‚úÖ Added `selectFolder()` method with folder listing and creation
   - ‚úÖ Added `createFolder()` method for creating folders
   - ‚úÖ Enhanced `downloadSnippets()` to support folder-specific downloads
   - ‚úÖ Fixed OAuth to use manifest.json client_id instead of env vars
   - ‚úÖ Added proper folder-based file searching

## üéØ Next Priority Actions

### üö® TABLESTAKES REQUIREMENT
**Google Drive integration is now TABLESTAKES - core functionality depends on it working properly.**

**REMAINING GOOGLE DRIVE WORK:**
1. **Setup real Google OAuth client ID** in manifest.json (currently using placeholder)
2. **Create folder selection UI** in options page for Google Drive folder management
3. **Test OAuth flow** and ensure tokens persist correctly across restarts
4. **Add folder selection for scoped snippets** (personal/team/org folders)

**CLEANUP TASKS:**
1. Clear any stored local filesystem sources from user storage
2. Create storage cleanup function to remove invalid sources

## üíæ Storage Architecture Decision
- ‚úÖ **Browser internal storage** (chrome.storage.local/sync) - persistent, reliable
- ‚úÖ **Cloud storage** (Google Drive/Dropbox/OneDrive) - persistent, shareable via folder IDs
- ‚ùå **Local filesystem** - abandoned due to File System Access API security limitations

## üêõ Known Issues to Address
- Service worker might still have stored invalid local filesystem sources in storage that need cleanup
- Options page may still show local filesystem UI that should be removed
- Auto-sync still tries to process any remaining local filesystem sources

## üìÅ Key Files Modified
- `src/shared/messaging.ts` - Added missing imports
- `src/shared/types.ts` - Added GET_SYNC_STATUS, ScopedSource interface, selectFolder method
- `src/background/sync-manager.ts` - Disabled auto-sync for local-filesystem
- `src/background/scoped-source-manager.ts` - Skip local filesystem in syncAllSources
- `src/options/options.html` - Removed team code input
- `src/options/options.ts` - Removed team code handlers
